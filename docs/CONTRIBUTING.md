# Contributing
Contributions aren't required, but they are definitely helpful for the developers of this project.

## Notes
* Whatever you do, **DO NOT ADD MULTIVERSION WITH PREPROCESSOR**. I am waiting for kotlin 1.7.10 support, and when that comes, then I'll switch to EGT.
* I will reject PRs that aren't descriptive in what they do, unless you have an idea of what you're doing.
