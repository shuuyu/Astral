# Astral
Stupid easy customizability with no compromises whatsoever. 

The name, Astral, was picked so Mixins 0.8.5 and Kotlin 1.7.0 would load first, as well as sounding so much better than 
other names. For context, the name was supposed to be spit, because I couldn't think of anything.

## This mod uses Essential
**What is Essential?**

Essential is a non-intrusive, quality of life mod that aims to improve your Minecraft playing and social experience.

**Can I get rid of Essential?**

No. Since we use Elementa to make the GUI, as well as relying on it for Mixins 0.8.5, and even the command, there is no
way to remove it. However, you can disable the cosmetics, as well as disagree with the TOS. More can be read about thier
