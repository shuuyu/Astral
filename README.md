**What is Essential?**

Essential is a non-intrusive, quality of life mod that aims to improve your Minecraft playing and social experience.

**Can I get rid of Essential?**

No. Since we use Elementa to make the GUI, as well as relying on it for Mixins 0.8.5, and even the command, there is no
way to remove it. However, you can disable the cosmetics, as well as disagree with the TOS. More can be read about thier
