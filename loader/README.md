# Loader
This is the loader that loads alongside Astral, which is meant to serve as a deterent for people.

So far, this only blacklists people, primarily ~~those I despise~~ ratters. If you want to be put on that list, just be an 
idiot and I'll go ahead and put you on there.

## Main reason why this loader exists
Any attempts to modify the contents of this jar (That isn't in a developer environment), will crash. This is an intentional
feature, as there should be absolutely NO REASON on why you should be modifying this project, unless you're a developer.
The most likely case of this is that you're planning to RAT someone, of which I need to stop you from doing. In this case, 
any and all attempts to remove the loader will result in some type of crash, as the loader is depended upon for half of
the features.
